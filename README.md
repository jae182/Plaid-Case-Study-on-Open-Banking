# Plaid Case Study on Open Banking
## How Plaid Came to Be
### The Idea was Born

Plaid was founded in May of 2013 by Zach Perret and William Hockey. Both Perret and Hockey were working for Bain & Company in the Atlanta office. The two founders bonded over rock climbing during their time at Bain & Company. They stated in an article with Forbes that they were tired of a lack of transparency with the bills    that they were paying and as a result they decided to try and create a financial planning tool that unfortunately did not work out. Although their app failed,      they did succeed in what would later be a critical step in establishing Plaid, being able to connect their bank accounts to their app. Hockey and Perret were able to set up a ping system to establish if the information regarding a user's accounts was active and had a balance or not. This came in handy when Venmo was struggling with real-time peer to peer transactions. Venmo's system at the time had a delay between the transaction made by the user and the actual transfer of money due to previous softwares being unable to check bank accounts without microtransactions. With Plaid's system of pinging bank accounts with the user's login info, they were able to help Venmo introduce a simultaneous transfer of funds. With the delay in the actual transaction gone, Venmo was able to become a popular mean of transactions. From there, Plaid had a profitable customer and a working product which inspired them to move to California and seek funding from VCs in Silicon Valley.

### The Path to Funding

Plaid was a start up that received funding from VCs seeding their company all the way to a Series D round in April of 2021 (crunchbase.com), which was primarily funded by larger investment companies. By the final round of funding, Plaid had received a total of $734.3 M. With the final round of funding, Plaid is now valued at roughly $13.4 B (Viktor, 2021). Plaid continues to make money with a freemium business model in which banks and other financial companies are able to use Plaid's software for free, with limited capabilities. If the banks or other financial companies decide to upgrade their services with Plaid, then there are a variety of fees that can be  associated with its usage, such as fees on transactions, checking account information, and a one-time fee for new users that connect to the Plaid API. Through this business model, Plaid is able to collect recurring amounts of income which increase as the user base and usage of the services increase. Plaid's revenue for 2021 is projected to be around $1.9 B (Kauflin, 2021).

## Plaid's Business Activities
### The Problem Plaid Works to Solve
The specific financial problem that Plaid is looking to solve is the issues that arise for some companies when looking to access a customer's bank and other        financial accounts. Plaid looked to make the linking of accounts simpler and would therefore make online financial services more accessible to current and          potential investors. By building the pipelines for third party apps to use when linking financial accounts, Plaid has been able to streamline their processing of    the customer's financial data. Plaid has made online financial services more viable, especially for new entrants to the online financial services industry (Schwiep, 2019).

### Plaid's Service and How it Benefits Customers
Plaid's intended customers are 3rd party apps that offer some sort of online financial service. Since Plaid has established the framework for relatively seamless    connection between the apps and a user's financial accounts, the most high value customers are going to rely on the infrastructure that Plaid has built. While      the number of potential customers is unknown, it is known that the total market cap surrounding open banking is around "$43.15 B" (Padua, 2021). This market is going to continue to have aggressive growth, thanks in large part to the global pandemic showing the need for a more effecient method of managing finances. While the freemium business model is not solely used by Plaid, where Plaid stands apart from their competitors, such as Finicity and MX Technologies, is in it's friendliness to startup fintech companies. It offers a clean and simple was to "connect with banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions" (Lawler, 2017). This means that startups are able to have a better shot at having a well polished product that is therefore more likely to be funded and used. By appealing to startups, Plaid essentially gets first contact with a large amount of possible customers to establish strong working relationships.

### Plaid's Use of Technology
Plaid has recently just migrated from a previous formatting language called Handlebars and a flat file generator used to gather static HTML, to a new framework      called React, which utilizes JavaScript to its full potential. Essentially the framework that Plaid was run on during their founding years has become unusable      now that the company has reached a critical mass of users. The old system had difficulty scaling and if they did not adapt, they would limit their ability to        innovate and therefore, survive (Kelly, 2020).

## Trends in Open Banking
### Open Banking So Far
In the beginning, Most apps looked to aggregate a customer's financial data all into one place so that customer's could see an overview of their finances. The idea of Open Banking was able to take off in early 2018 when "the goverment agreed to implement a Consumer Data Right" (Deloitte, 2020). This gave consumer's greater control over their data which opened the door for sharing the data with third party companies. With this level of data security and freedom to consumers, companies such as Plaid were able to aggregate all the financial data they had collected about their users and, with the consumer's permission, allow third party financial services access to this data. By 2020, the  scope available to these companies were able to use the data that was being provided to offer a larger variety of products, from different accounts to personal and mortgage loans. As of 2021, these products have became available, such as investment plans, lines of credit, and retirement savings accounts. As the number of products continues to increase, the security of the data and it's usage has become the primary topics surrounding the Open Banking domain.
