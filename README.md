# Plaid Case Study on Open Banking
## How Plaid Came to Be
### The Idea was Born

Plaid was founded in May of 2013 by Zach Perret and William Hockey. Both Perret and Hockey were working for Bain & Company in the Atlanta office. The two founders bonded over rock climbing during their time at Bain & Company. They stated in an article with Forbes that they were tired of a lack of transparency with the bills    that they were paying and as a result they decided to try and create a financial planning tool that unfortunately did not work out. Although their app failed,      they did succeed in what would later be a critical step in establishing Plaid, being able to connect their bank accounts to their app. Hockey and Perret were able to set up a ping system to establish if the information regarding a user's accounts was active and had a balance or not. This came in handy when Venmo was struggling with real-time peer to peer transactions. Venmo's system at the time had a delay between the transaction made by the user and the actual transfer of money due to previous softwares being unable to check bank accounts without microtransactions. With Plaid's system of pinging bank accounts with the user's login info, they were able to help Venmo introduce a simultaneous transfer of funds. With the delay in the actual transaction gone, Venmo was able to become a popular mean of transactions. From there, Plaid had a profitable customer and a working product which inspired them to move to California and seek funding from VCs in Silicon Valley.

### The Path to Funding

Plaid was a start up that received funding from VCs seeding their company all the way to a Series D round in April of 2021 (crunchbase.com), which was primarily funded by larger investment companies. By the final round of funding, Plaid had received a total of $734.3 M. With the final round of funding, Plaid is now valued at roughly $13.4 B (Viktor, 2021). Plaid continues to make money with a freemium business model in which banks and other financial companies are able to use Plaid's software for free, with limited capabilities. If the banks or other financial companies decide to upgrade their services with Plaid, then there are a variety of fees that can be  associated with its usage, such as fees on transactions, checking account information, and a one-time fee for new users that connect to the Plaid API. Through this business model, Plaid is able to collect recurring amounts of income which increase as the user base and usage of the services increase. Plaid's revenue for 2021 is projected to be around $1.9 B (Kauflin, 2021).

## Plaid's Business Activities
### The Problem Plaid Works to Solve
The specific financial problem that Plaid is looking to solve is the issues that arise for some companies when looking to access a customer's bank and other        financial accounts. Plaid looked to make the linking of accounts simpler and would therefore make online financial services more accessible to current and          potential investors. By building the pipelines for third party apps to use when linking financial accounts, Plaid has been able to streamline their processing of    the customer's financial data. Plaid has made online financial services more viable, especially for new entrants to the online financial services industry (Schwiep, 2019).

### Plaid's Service and How it Benefits Customers
Plaid's intended customers are 3rd party apps that offer some sort of online financial service. Since Plaid has established the framework for relatively seamless    connection between the apps and a user's financial accounts, the most high value customers are going to rely on the infrastructure that Plaid has built. While      the number of potential customers is unknown, it is known that the total market cap surrounding open banking is around "$43.15 B" (Padua, 2021). This market is going to continue to have aggressive growth, thanks in large part to the global pandemic showing the need for a more effecient method of managing finances. While the freemium business model is not solely used by Plaid, where Plaid stands apart from their competitors, such as Finicity and MX Technologies, is in it's friendliness to startup fintech companies. It offers a clean and simple was to "connect with banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions" (Lawler, 2017). This means that startups are able to have a better shot at having a well polished product that is therefore more likely to be funded and used. By appealing to startups, Plaid essentially gets first contact with a large amount of possible customers to establish strong working relationships.

### Plaid's Use of Technology
Plaid has recently just migrated from a previous formatting language called Handlebars and a flat file generator used to gather static HTML, to a new framework      called React, which utilizes JavaScript to its full potential. Essentially the framework that Plaid was run on during their founding years has become unusable      now that the company has reached a critical mass of users. The old system had difficulty scaling and if they did not adapt, they would limit their ability to        innovate and therefore, survive (Kelly, 2020).

## Trends in Open Banking
### Open Banking So Far
In the beginning, Most apps looked to aggregate a customer's financial data all into one place so that customer's could see an overview of their finances. The idea of Open Banking was able to take off in early 2018 when "the goverment agreed to implement a Consumer Data Right" (Deloitte, 2020). This gave consumer's greater control over their data which opened the door for sharing the data with third party companies. With this level of data security and freedom to consumers, companies such as Plaid were able to aggregate all the financial data they had collected about their users and, with the consumer's permission, allow third party financial services access to this data. By 2020, the  scope available to these companies were able to use the data that was being provided to offer a larger variety of products, from different accounts to personal and mortgage loans. As of 2021, these products have became available, such as investment plans, lines of credit, and retirement savings accounts. As the number of products continues to increase, the security of the data and it's usage has become the primary topics surrounding the Open Banking domain.

### Major Companies Within Open Banking
Besides Plaid, there are a host of other open banking companies using API to aggregate financial data and offer more personalized financial services. MX             Technologies is a major player in the US in establishing the framework for Open Banking. MX works to aggregate separate financial systems and unify them into       one comnprehensive system. With this, they are able to offer many solutions based on the data through data analysis, enhancement, and personalized marketing (mx.com, 2021). Another major player is a London based Open Banking company called Thought Machine. Thought Machine takes a different approach to Online Banking by being a cloud-based system that offers services from other business and banks to consumers (Lunden, 2020). By having the financial institutions go through Thought Machine, thought machine can use the data that is given to them to optimize services for the consumers.

## Plaid in the Open Banking Domain
### How Plaid Impacted Open Banking
Plaid has made an impact in the Open Banking domain by being partnered with several major banks and financial services (Geron, 2021). With their software being used to connect otherwise disconnected services, Plaid has helped to open up many different channels for customers that they may have been unaware of. An important aspect of Open Banking is the fact that it allows data to be used to include users who may have felt that their options are limited by their finances or by their    understanding of different financial services. While Plaid is not the sole company dedicated to working to increase the validity and acceptance of Open Banking,     their reach and assistance with startups gives domain a strong foothold in current and future companies that will be looking to take advantage of the data           gathered by Plaid.

### Plaid Compared to Competition
Some metrics to take into account when measuring the success of Open Banking companies are the rate of Successful API Calls and Rejected/Failed API Calls and       the cost of implementing these APIs. Beginning with probably the most important metric to major companies, Plaid's failure/rejection rate hovers around 2-5%.       This means that out of 100 transactions, anywhere between 2-5 transactions can fail (Konrad). Most major companies would prefer to have that failure rate closer to the 1-.001% range. This will need to be improved in the future for Plaid to be truly accepted as a reliable Open Banking source. When it comes to pricing, Plaid  offers rates that are competitive with other Open Banking comapnies. They offered a tiered payment system, where you can start out for free with 100 available       APIs. If you will need more for your business, then you are welcome to scale up to a Pay as You Go program. From this, businesses can expect $1.00 - $2.00 fees     for one time calls, such as Authorization and Identification tests. With more recurring interactions, such as transactions between systems, businesses can           expect a $0.30 fee for each call (Treece, 2021). Plaid offers volume discounts, so as calls and users increase, the cost per call will decrease (Treece, 2021). The final payment option available, typically for enterprises and companies looking to scale, there is a base fee of $500 that includes 200 free API with any additional APIs subject to a fee. This fee is subject to volume discounts as well. 

When taking a look at Plaid compared to their primary competitors based on these core metrics, there are 2 other companies who are comparable in terms of services that are relatively equivalent to Plaid. One of the companies is Synapse. Synapse is an FinTech company that offers banking as an online service. They offer businesses some of the same services as Plaid, APIs to use for online financial accounts for deposits, credit, and crypto according to their website homepage. In one of the main metrics that businesses looking for reliable APIs to help with connection to online financial services, a company's failure rate. Synapse boasts a 99.99% success rate when it come to their non-beta products. This is higher rate than Plaid is currently able to offer, however, this could possibly be due to Plaid offering more services and connections with online financial services. When it comes to the pricing for the use of the APIs, Synapse breaks the standard of a tiered pricing system. Synapse does not offer a free trial with limited API or a freemium pricing option. Synapse has a single payment option for $25 per month. This is because Synapse looks to offer pointed services rather than a cover-all type of system. Another big name in the Open Banking domain is Yodlee. Yodlee is a data aggregation and analysis platform that is used by 1,400 financial institutions and 15 of the 20 top banks in the U.S. Data on Yodlee's success and failure rate is not published on public record but according to the Key Vendor Evaluation Criteria for Fintech Adopters report (2020) conducted by Lendit Fintech suggests that the typical FinTech company success rate can be estimated around low to mid 90s. If Yodlee's rate is roughly equivalent to this report, then it should be assumed that they are on par with Plaid in terms of its failure rate. When it comes to Yodlee's pricing options, it has a similar structure as Plaid in that it offers a tiered pricing system. They offer a sandbox option that is free and allows access to some poertions of the Yodlee API and 5 free users. Another tier is for upstarts that need access to Yodlee's data. With this come 100 free activities and support from Yodlee. The next tier is for growing companies. This program is frun at $500 per month and offers 1000 activites per billing period. For any companies that need more support for users and API, Yodlee offers another tier, but pricing is based on the company's needs. When it comes to pricing, Yodlee is roughly on par with Plaid, but there is no mention of volume based discounts as with Plaid.

## Possible Future for Plaid
### Recommendation for Future Product/Service
One possible service that Plaid should offer in the future is something that other online financial services, such as Yodlee and MX Technologies, offer: data analysis. By incorporating a data analysis aspect to Plaid's services, they would be able to offer an extra boost to the startups that Plaid already targets. With today's ever-changing world, and the FinTech realm matching or exceeding that rate of change, it is necessary for "startups to embrace analytics early on" (Kuznetsov, 2017). By embracing big data and its advantages, younger and smaller companies need to be able to have access to the analytics of their respective industries to allow for the best possible user experience. In a FinTech podcast called Breaking Banks, the host has interviewed over 100 FinTech professionals, and he states that the Golden Rule of FinTech should be that the user should drive change. This means that decisions should be based on maximizing the user's experience. With a devoted data analytics program, Plaid will be able to help their users to maximize their potential and allow them the best possible chance of surviving the beginning stages of business. While charging more for this service would be the best way to increse Plaid's profits, it may not be the best option since this tool would be primarily to help startups. Plaid could offer the program as an extra feature for their customers at a cost, or increase one-time and per-transaction fees to compensate for the usage of the data analytics. Both options may be beneficial for the initial roll-out of the program and as more users and data aggregate, Plaid can use the volume to offer discounted prices for the increased amount of data. Plaid could utilize Predictive Analytics to help the startups that use their services make business decisions based on data rather than best-guess methods. This provides the startups with strong market data to make decisions that can help to direct the company in the face of uncertain conditions. Another technology that Plaid could utilize is Stream Analytics. By using this, they would be able to aggregate data across different platforms and perform analysis on it. This would create data sets that are able to provide a more holistic idea of an individuals financial decision making. This can provide companies with better data to work from. By implementing and utilizing these data analytics methods, Plaid could provide better services to their startup customers, which in turn allows them to grow and continue to provide revenue for Plaid.
