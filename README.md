# Plaid Case Study on Open Banking
## How Plaid Came to Be

Plaid was founded in May of 2013 by Zach Perret and William Hockey. Both Perret and Hockey were working for Bain & Company in the Atlanta office. The two founders bonded over rock climbing during their time at Bain & Company. They stated in an article with Forbes that they were tired of a lack of transparency with the bills    that they were paying and as a result they decided to try and create a financial planning tool that unfortunately did not work out. Although their app failed,      they did succeed in what would later be a critical step in establishing Plaid, being able to connect their bank accounts to their app. Hockey and Perret were able to set up a ping system to establish if the information regarding a user's accounts was active and had a balance or not. This came in handy when Venmo was struggling with real-time peer to peer transactions. Venmo's system at the time had a delay between the transaction made by the user and the actual transfer of money due to previous softwares being unable to check bank accounts without microtransactions. With Plaid's system of pinging bank accounts with the user's login info, they were able to help Venmo introduce a simultaneous transfer of funds. With the delay in the actual transaction gone, Venmo was able to become a popular mean of transactions. From there, Plaid had a profitable customer and a working product which inspired them to move to California and seek funding from VCs in Silicon Valley.
