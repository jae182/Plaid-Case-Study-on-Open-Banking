3. Who are the founders of this company?
   Zach Perret and William Hockey
   
4. How did the idea for the company come about?
   Perret and Hockey were working for Bain's Atlanta office and bonded over rock climbing. They stated that they were tired of a lack of transparency with the bills    that they were paying and as a result they decided to try and create a financial planning tool that unfortunately did not work out. Although their app failed,      they did succeed in being able to connect their bank accounts to their app. Hockey and Perret were able to set up a ping system to establish if the information      regarding a user's accounts was active and had a balance or not. This came in handy when Venmo was struggling with real-time peer to peer transactions. Venmo's      system at the time had a delay between the transaction made by the user and the actual transfer of money due to previous softwares being unable to check bank        accounts without microtransactions. With Plaid's system of pinging bank accounts with the user's login info, they were able to help Venmo introduce a                simultaneous transfer of funds. With the delay in the actual transaction gone, Venmo was able to become a popular mean of transactions. From there, Plaid had a      customer and a working product which inspired them to move to California and seek funding from VCs in Silicon Valley.

5. How is this company funded? How much funding has this company received?
   Plaid was a start up that received funding from VCs seeding their company all the way to a Series D round in April of 2021, which was primarily funded by larger    investment companies. By the final round of funding, Plaid had received a total of $734.3 M. With the final round of funding, Plaid is now valued at roughly        $13.4 B. Plaid continues to make money with a freemium business model in which banks and other financial companies are able to use Plaid's software for free,        with limited capabilities. If the banks or other financial companies decide to upgrade their services with Plaid, then there are a variety of fees that can be      associated with its usage, such as fees on transactions, checking account information, and a one-time fee for new users that connect to the Plaid API. Through      this business model, Plaid is able to collect recurring amounts of income which increase as the user base and usage of the services increase. Plaid's revenue for    2021 is projected to be around $1.9 B.

6. What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve?
   The specific financial problem that Plaid is looking to solve is the issues that arise for some companies when looking to access a customer's bank and other        financial accounts. Plaid looked to make the linking of accounts simpler and would therefore make online financial services more accessible to current and          potential investors. By building the pipelines for third party apps to use when linking financial accounts, Plaid has been able to streamline their processing of    the customer's financial health/holdings. Plaid has made online financial services more viable, especially for new entrants to the online financial services        industry.
