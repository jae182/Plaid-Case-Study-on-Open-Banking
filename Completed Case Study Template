1. Name of company
   Plaid
   
2. When was the company incorporated?
   Plaid was founded in May of 2013 and is currently headquartered in San Francisco, California.
   
3. Who are the founders of this company?
   Zach Perret and William Hockey
   
4. How did the idea for the company come about?
   Perret and Hockey were working for Bain's Atlanta office and bonded over rock climbing. They stated that they were tired of a lack of transparency with the bills    that they were paying and as a result they decided to try and create a financial planning tool that unfortunately did not work out. Although their app failed,      they did succeed in being able to connect their bank accounts to their app. Hockey and Perret were able to set up a ping system to establish if the information      regarding a user's accounts was active and had a balance or not. This came in handy when Venmo was struggling with real-time peer to peer transactions. Venmo's      system at the time had a delay between the transaction made by the user and the actual transfer of money due to previous softwares being unable to check bank        accounts without microtransactions. With Plaid's system of pinging bank accounts with the user's login info, they were able to help Venmo introduce a                simultaneous transfer of funds. With the delay in the actual transaction gone, Venmo was able to become a popular mean of transactions. From there, Plaid had a      customer and a working product which inspired them to move to California and seek funding from VCs in Silicon Valley.

5. How is this company funded? How much funding has this company received?
   Plaid was a start up that received funding from VCs seeding their company all the way to a Series D round in April of 2021, which was primarily funded by larger    investment companies. By the final round of funding, Plaid had received a total of $734.3 M. With the final round of funding, Plaid is now valued at roughly        $13.4 B. Plaid continues to make money with a freemium business model in which banks and other financial companies are able to use Plaid's software for free,        with limited capabilities. If the banks or other financial companies decide to upgrade their services with Plaid, then there are a variety of fees that can be      associated with its usage, such as fees on transactions, checking account information, and a one-time fee for new users that connect to the Plaid API. Through      this business model, Plaid is able to collect recurring amounts of income which increase as the user base and usage of the services increase. Plaid's revenue for    2021 is projected to be around $1.9 B.

6. What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve?
   The specific financial problem that Plaid is looking to solve is the issues that arise for some companies when looking to access a customer's bank and other        financial accounts. Plaid looked to make the linking of accounts simpler and would therefore make online financial services more accessible to current and          potential investors. By building the pipelines for third party apps to use when linking financial accounts, Plaid has been able to streamline their processing of    the customer's financial health/holdings. Plaid has made online financial services more viable, especially for new entrants to the online financial services        industry. (https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/plaid/)

7. Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
   Plaid's intended customers are 3rd party apps that offer some sort of online financial service. Since Plaid has established the framework for relatively seamless    connection between the apps and a user's financial accounts, the most high value customers are going to rely on the infrastructure that Plaid has built. While      the number of potential customers is unknown, it is known that the total market cap surrounding open banking is around $43.15 B. This market is going to continue    to have aggressive growth, thanks in large part to the global pandemic showing the need for a more effecient method of managing finances. While the freemium        business model is not solely used by Plaid, where Plaid stands apart from their competitors, such as Finicity and MX Technologies, is in it's friendliness to        startup fintech companies. It offers a clean and simple was to "connect with banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions". This means that        startups are able to have a better shot at having a well polished product that is therefore more likely to be invested in and used. By appealing to startups,        Plaid essentially gets first contact with a large amount of possible customers to establish strong working relationships.

8. Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
   Plaid has recently just migrated from a previous formatting language called Handlebars and a flat file generator used to gather static HTML, to a new framework      called React, which utilizes JavaScript to its full potential. Essentially the framework that Plaid was run on during their founding years has become unusable      now that the company has reached a critical mass of users. The old system had difficulty scaling and if they did not adapt, they would limit their ability to        innovate and therefore, survive. (https://plaid.com/blog/handlebars-to-react-migration/)

9. What domain is the company in?
   Plaid is building the framework to make Open Banking a common practice for most banks and third party apps.
   
10. What have been the major trends and innovations in this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    While Plaid has been active since 2013, the apps and programs that would become staples of the Open Banking domain were still relatively simple. Most apps           looked to aggregate a customer's financial data all into one place so that customer's could see an overview of their finances. The idea of Open Banking was able     to take off in early 2018 when the goverment implemented a Consumer Data Right. This gave consumer's greater control over their data which opened the door for       sharing the data with third party companies. With this level of data security and freedom to consumers, companies such as Plaid were able to aggregate all the       financial data they had collected about their users and, with the consumer's permission, allow third party financial services access to this data. By 2020, the     scope available to these companies were able to use the data that was being provided to offer a larger variety of products, from different accounts to personal     and mortgage loans. As of 2021, these products have became available, such as investment plans, lines of credit, and retirement savings accounts. As the number     of products continues to increase, the security of the data and it's usage has become the primary topics surrounding the Open Banking domain.

11. What are the other major companies in this domain?
    Besides Plaid, there are a host of other open banking companies using API to aggregate financial data and offer more personalized financial services. MX             Technologies is a major player in the US in establishing the framework for Open Banking. MX works to aggregate separate financial systems and unify them into       one comnprehensive system. With this, they are able to offer many solutions based on the data through data analysis, enhancement, and personalized marketing.       Another major player is a London based Open Banking company called Thought Machine. Thought Machine takes a different approach to Online Banking by being a         cloud-based system that offers services from other business and banks to consumers. By having the financial institutions go through Thought Machine, thought         machine can use the data that is given to them to optimize services for the consumers.

12. What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    Plaid has made an impact in the Open Banking domain by being partnered with several major banks and financial services. With their software being used to           connect otherwise disconnected services, Plaid has helped to open up many different channels for customers that they may have been aware of. An important aspect     of Open Banking is the fact that it allows data to be used to include users who may have felt that their options are limited by their finances or by their           understanding of different financial services. While Plaid is not the sole company dedicated to working to increase the validity and acceptance of Open Banking,     their reach and assistance with startups gives domain a strong foothold in current and future companies that will be looking to take advantage of the data           gathered by Plaid.

13. What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    Some metrics to take into account when measuring the success of Open Banking companies are Average API Availabililty, Average API Call Response Time, and the rate of Successful API Calls and Rejected/Failed API Calls. Beginning with probably the most important metric to major companies, Plaid's failure/rejection rate hovers around 2-5%. This means that out of 100 transactions, anywhere between 2-5 transactions can fail. Most major companies would prefer to have that failure rate closer to the 1-.001% range. This will need to be improved in the future for Plaid to be truly accepted as an Open Banking source. In terms of the API Call Response Time,
